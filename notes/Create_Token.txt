-- totalSupply: A method that defines the total supply of your tokens, When this limit is reached the smart contract will refuse to create new tokens.

-- balanceOf: A method that returns the number of tokens a wallet address has.

-- transferFrom: Another type of transfer method which is used to transfer tokens between users.

-- approve: This method verifies whether a smart contract is allowed to allocate a certain amount of tokens to a user, considering the total supply.
