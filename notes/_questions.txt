	List of questions as I encounter issues or thoughts
*/

1 - Safemath.sol   Do I import the file or copy the code in to the file.   I know I can import to where i need it (import "./safemath.sol";) just wondering about the source file.  

2 - pragma solidity version?  How do I how what version to use? based on complier only?

3 - can I deploy locally first using ganache?  or is that used to deploy to sepolia.  Seems like with ganache I created a local network. <- answered.  Not sure I need it at all.  It appears to be like a local blockchain.

4 - .env file?  where is this file located?  I see it in the code but not in the file structure.  Is this a file I need to create? <- answered

5. - THe hardhat.config file.  I did it diferent than you did.  But I understand how you did it.  Just have questions on....

		   sepolia: {
      		url: process.env.SEPOLIA_URL || "",
      		accounts:
        		process.env.PRIVATE_KEY !== undefined ? [process.env.PRIVATE_KEY] : [], // this is the line I am not sure about
		   }

6. Okay with tests,  What is going on? is chai creating a something that pretends it's calling the contract and testing all its functions?

7. My test failed for total supply failed at first, I didnt have the correct number in the test `expect(await StaubToken.totalSupply()).to.equal(ethers.utils.parseEther("1000000"));` I had 10000000000000.  wha tis ethers.utils.parseEhter?

8. That brings up another question, How do I know what to test?  Test each function/event? I have a feeling this is the million dolloar question.  I am sure it depends on the contract.  But I am sure there are some best practices.  I am sure I will learn more as I go.  But I am just curious if there is a general rule of thumb.

Assignment #2 Questions:

1. How Do I know the owner is?  Is it the contact that deploys the contract?  say for fees paid back to owner do you use you address?  or is it the address that deployed the contract?

2. For deploying,  I updated my deploy.js file to have both my contracts in it.  Now when say I use the general delpoy command `npx hardhat run --network localhost scripts/deploy.js` it will of ocurse run both deploy code blocks.  How do I do this if I only want to deploy one of them?

3. How can test the coin when I have deployed to the local hardhat network?

4. Can I have it owner and payable for the mint function?

5. Lets walk throught the functions??

6 deploy.js file.  I have two contracts in it, can I pick just one to deploy or simply comment it out?

7.
